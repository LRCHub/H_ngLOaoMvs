Chaos, disorder
Mathematics of our creation
Mistakes bring deceit
Acknowledgment of our demise
Transcend the strength
Future messenger of all that's dead
Quench a blind man's thirst
The list of curse, reversed

Enter the glorious faith
In full shocking effect
All along this deadly river
Flowing through these veins

Worlds twist into convulsion
Suffocating myth arise
Shocked beliefs of slaves embedded
Reborn fear in man create

Onwards to the throne of sorrow
Bow down to the gods of war
Set forth to the throne of sorrow
Eradication, manipulation

Onwards to the throne of sorrow
Bow down to the gods of war
Set forth to the throne of sorrow
Eradication, manipulation

Hurricanes of contradictions
Whirlwinds of dissolution

The waves come crashing down
Will you live or will you drown?
Drown in a taste of
Your miserable life

-Solo-

Set the hell hounds loose
Bring me the cold and stale heart
Of the ones taking me apart (apart)

Worlds twist in convulsion
Suffocating myth arise
Shocked beliefs of
Slaves embedded
Reborn fear in man create

Onwards to the throne of sorrow
Bow down to the gods of war
Set forth to the throne of sorrow
Eradication, manipulation

Onwards to the throne of sorrow
Bow down to the gods of war
Set forth to the throne of sorrow
Eradication, manipulation

Hurricanes of contradictions
Whirlwinds of dissolution
